Dylan is a college football player. He has his very first collegiate game tomorrow, but as he is a freshman and new to the program 
he doesn't expect to get into the game at all. Especially due to the fact that he plays quarterback and the senior who starts for their 
team is an all-star who is projected to be picked second in the professional football draft. Dylan came ready to watch the first gameday
from the sidelines but when he showed up to the field his coach has some interesting news for him. 

The senior, all-star quarterback sprained his ankle during warm ups, so Dylan will be starting the game. Dylan is excited because even 
though he did not think he was going to start, he had prepared all week as though he was going to. Dylan started the game a little shaky
throwing an interception in the first quarter. He then settled in and threw two touchdows in the third quarter to tie the game going
into the 4th. 

Keeping up his strong second half performance, Dylan kept his team in the game despite his defence's shortcomings. The game is now in the final two minutes.
The score remains all tied up. Dylan and his team have the ball at the 20 yard line, with no timeouts remaining. "Run the ball" said the coach,
whose trust in Dylan was not so great. Dylan does as he's asked, but little progress is made. A few plays later, Dylan's team has only made it to
the 50 yard line, but now with only 20 seconds to play. Dylan realizes he must make a play with his arm now. The next play, Dylan drops back to pass 
but... BLITZ! Dylan is sacked. They have no choice but to spike the football and try for a hail mary. 4th down. Dylan gets the ball, looks down the field
and launches the ball 60 yards in the air to the endzone. Miraculously, the ball is caught by the teams star 6-foot-9 wide receiver in the endzone. Game over.
Dylan is a hero.
