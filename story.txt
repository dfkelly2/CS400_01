Dylan is a college football player. He has his very first collegiate game tomorrow, but as he is a freshman and new to the program 
he doesn't expect to get into the game at all. Especially due to the fact that he plays quarterback and the senior who starts for their 
team is an all-star who is projected to be picked second in the professional football draft. Dylan came ready to watch the first gameday
from the sidelines but when he showed up to the field his coach has some interesting news for him.
