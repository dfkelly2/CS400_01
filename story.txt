Dylan is a college football player. He has his very first collegiate game tomorrow, but as he is a freshman and new to the program 
he doesn't expect to get into the game at all. Especially due to the fact that he plays quarterback and the senior who starts for their 
team is an all-star who is projected to be picked second in the professional football draft. Dylan came ready to watch the first gameday
from the sidelines but when he showed up to the field his coach has some interesting news for him. 

The senior, all-star quarterback sprained his ankle during warm ups, so Dylan will be starting the game. Dylan is excited because even 
though he did not think he was going to start, he had prepared all week as though he was going to. Dylan started the game a little shaky
throwing an interception in the first quarter. He then settled in and threw two touchdows in the third quarter to tie the game going
into the 4th.
